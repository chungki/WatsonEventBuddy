# Watson Event Buddy
In this developer journey we will build a Watson Event Buddy which is a cognitive chatbot designed to help users easily find and purchase event tickets based upon a machine learning model.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Build a Watson Event Buddy that converses using Watson Conversation
* Use Watson Text to Speech to converse with Event Buddy
* Use Watson Machine Learning to recommend what type of event is of interest to the user (ie: art, music, sport)
* Use Ticketmaster API to search for events based upon location, type and date
* Use Twilio to send SMS text messages with link to purchase tickets from Ticketmaster

## 6. Register for Twilio Service
One of the main functions of `Watson Event Buddy` is to text the link to purchase tickets to the user. To send SMS text messages, we use the Twilio service. Register for a free trial account at [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).

As part of the service, you will be assigned the following values, which you will need to save, they are accessible through your user account settings:
- Account SID
- Authentication Token

![](images/Twilio/twilio.png)

Lastly, you will need a Twilio supplied phone number, where all texts will originate from. To create one, navigate to the *Programmable SMS* option
in the context menu.

![](images/Twilio/number.png)

- Twilio supplied phone number

By default, you will only be able to send SMS text messages to the phone
number you provided to create your account. To send messages to other
numbers, you need to add them at [https://www.twilio.com/console](https://www.twilio.com/).
For each number you enter, the user of the number will be asked to verify
and then be sent a verification code. You will then need to enter this
verification code to complete the registration process.

## 7. Enable Node-RED Service

Launch [NodeRED Starter](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/node-red-starter)

Under Connections, **Create Connection** to the previous provisioned services: *Text to Speech*, *Watson Conversation*, *Machine Learning*

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="100" src="images/NodeRed/Deploy.png">
</p>


## 8. Deploy Front-End Application

The next step is to create a sample application that connects to your NodeRed flow. When you click on the button below, you will be taken to bluemix DevOps page. This will automatically create a new application for you, via the DevOps ToolChain. If you are not logged on to BlueMix you will need to logon.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/loren-murphy/WCS-Event-Client.git)


Click the deploy button, after about 1 minute or so, your screen will change to something like the following:

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="300" src="images/frontend/toolchain.png">
</p>

Click on the **Deliver** tile

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="300" src="images/frontend/DeliverTile.png">
</p>


Once the message in the deploy tile has changed to passed from Deploy running, click on the **Rocket** icon under **Last Executed Results**


<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" src="images/frontend/DeployStage.png">
</p>

This will take you to the newly created applications. Click on the **Runtime** link on the left and your screen should change, then click on **environment variables** tab in the middle of the screen. It should look like the following:

![](images/frontend/AppRuntime.png)


In the CONVERSATION_URL value change the "xxxxxx" to the hostname of your NodeRed application. This comes from the NodeRed url where you created your NodeRed flow. Do not include "/red/#. Your values will be different.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="100" src="images/frontend/ConversationURL.png">
</p>


Click the **Save** button. The application will restart.

Click on the Visit App URL. This is at the top of the page. You will land on the following page.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="300" src="images/frontend/ClientWebpage.png">
</p>


# Sample Output

Textual version of a sample conversation with Watson Event Buddy:

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" src="images/frontend/Convo1.png">
</p>


<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="400" src="images/frontend/Convo2.png">
</p>

Here is a recap of the services used to perform this conversation:
- **Node-RED:** Used to create a flow which tied together the various Watson services
- **Watson Conversation:** The conversation flow.
- **Watson Text-To-Speech:** Converts Event Buddy replies to sound.
- **Watson Machine Learning Model:** Based upon the user's information (age, gender, profession, martial status, and location) a type of event is recommended to the user (ie: music, arts, sports etc) using a ML model.
- **Ticketmaster Data:** Based upon when the user would like to attend the event, the city, and the type of event returned from ML model, Ticketmaster returns a list of upcoming events.  
- **Twilio:** Texts user the link to purchase the ticket for the show


# Troubleshooting

### Not hearing Watson read the text out-loud
Make sure a browser tab with the "Node-RED" flow is open. The audio output node selected within the flow requires the browser tab to be open.

### Ticketmaster does not return an event
Currently the start and end dates for ticketmaster API call are hard-coded. Within the node-RED flow, open the **Set headers for TicketMaster** node. Make sure the start and end date is set appropriately. The Ticketmaster API currently does not search for past events.

### Watson Conversation stops and does not return anything
Watson Conversation is currently coded for "happy-path" only. It is recommended you follow the sample output path above. You can further extend the Watson Conversation service to include "non-happy paths". For instance, the person does not want Watson's help in finding an event or they do not like the recommended type of event.

### Twilio is Not Texting user
Make sure the number you are texting has been registered within the Twilio Application. If not, add the number at [https://www.twilio.com/console](https://www.twilio.com/).
For each number you enter, the user of the number will be asked to verify
and then be sent a verification code. You will then need to enter this
verification code to complete the registration process.
